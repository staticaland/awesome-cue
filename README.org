#+title: Awesome CUE

* How I learned CUE

I have heard some people say the CUE website is intimidating. I think this is
because too many concepts are introduced at once, and things are not introduced
in the best order. The menu on the left contains many topics.

First you should read [[https://cuelang.org/docs/install/][Getting Started | CUE]] and install CUE. After this I would
go straight to the [[https://cuelang.org/docs/tutorials/tour/intro/][Introduction | CUE]] tutorial. Try to grok:

- [[https://cuelang.org/docs/tutorials/tour/intro/constraints/][Constraints | CUE]]
- [[https://cuetorials.com/overview/foundations/#conjunctions][Foundations | Overview | Cuetorials]]
  - Explains conjunctions.
- [[https://cuelang.org/docs/tutorials/tour/intro/schema/][Definitions | CUE]]
  - Introduces the conjunction operator =&= without having introduced it.
- [[https://docs.dagger.io/1215/what-is-cue/][What is CUE? | Dagger]] is also interesting. They use the word *embedding* to
  describe how the conjunction operator works. CUE works by
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance][Composition over
  inheritance]], which is a very good thing.

You need to understand what =#= and =_#= means. You also need to understand =&=.

You can import any YAML or JSON file with =cue import=. Wrap the data in a
object and try to add some schema definitions to it.
